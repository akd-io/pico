# AKD's PICO-8 and Picotron projects

## Picotron

### Setup

This repo stores a picotron drive at `picotron/drive`. To use this as your Picotron drive, and commit changes to the repo, update your `picotron_config.txt` to point to this repo's `picotron/drive` folder.

On my machine, `picotron_config.txt` was located at `/Users/akd/Library/Application Support/Picotron/picotron_config.txt`, and I updated it to:

```
# picotron config

mount / /Users/akd/workspace/pico/picotron/drive
```
